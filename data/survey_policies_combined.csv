Industrial Districts established; purposes.  

(1)	The primary purpose of the I-1 (Light Industrial) district is to create and protect industrial areas for light manufacturing and the distribution of products at wholesale.  The standards established for this district are designed to promote sound and permanent light industrial development and also to protect nearby residential areas from undesirable aspects of industrial development.  Whenever possible, this district should be separated from residential zoning districts by natural or structural boundaries such as drainage channels, sharp breaks in topography, strips of vegetation, traffic arteries, and similar features.  

(2)	The purpose of the I-2 (General Industrial) district is to create and protect wholesaling and industrial areas for manufacturing, processing and assembling of parts and products, distribution of products at wholesale, transportation terminals, and a broad variety of specialized industrial operations.  Whenever possible, areas of this district should be separated from residential districts by natural or structural boundaries such as drainage channels, sharp breaks in topography, strips of vegetation, traffic arteries and similar features.
